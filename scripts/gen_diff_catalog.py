"""Regenerate the template-derived sections of the English catalog.

Approval summaries, diffs, version summaries, MESA suggestion reasons,
notifications and voice declines are authored once, as Python templates in
const.py: the same sentence is persisted on records (the audit trail) and
rendered by the panel in the operator's language. This copies those template
dicts into custom_components/phoenix_mcp/catalogs/en.json (panel.diff,
panel.approvalSummary, panel.version, panel.mesaSuggestion, notification and
voice).

Run after adding or changing a template. A contract test fails when the
catalog and the templates disagree.
