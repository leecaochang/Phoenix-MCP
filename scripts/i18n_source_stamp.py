"""Record which English each locale was translated from, and report the drift.

Other i18n guards judge a locale against the current en.json, so a translation
made from English that has since been reworded passes all of them and keeps
stating the old behaviour. This stamps a fingerprint of the English behind each
translated key into tests/contract/i18n_source_hashes.json; when the English
moves, the stamp no longer matches and a drift test names the keys.

Re-stamping without retranslating is legal (an English typo fix does not
invalidate a translation) but shows up as a visible line in the diff. Only the
fingerprint is stored; the English is in en.json's git history.
scripts/i18n_merge_locale.py stamps what it merges, so a locale written the
normal way needs nothing here.

Run: python scripts/i18n_source_stamp.py zh-Hans
     python scripts/i18n_source_stamp.py --all
