"""Vendor a copy of mesa-core into custom_components/phoenix_mcp/mesa_core/.

mesa-core is developed as a separate, read-only project. Phoenix MCP ships HACS users a
vendored copy so the integration remains self-contained rather than resolving a
separate mesa-core package at install time. The source uses absolute imports rooted
at ``mesa_core``; vendoring under
``custom_components.phoenix_mcp`` requires rewriting those to the vendored path so the
copy is hermetic and never collides with a future ``pip install mesa-core`` or
another integration's copy.

This script reads the source tree only. It never modifies mesa-core. Re-run it
to re-sync after the upstream library changes; commit the regenerated
``mesa_core/`` directory.

Usage:
    python scripts/sync_mesa_core.py [SOURCE_DIR]   re-vendor from source
    python scripts/sync_mesa_core.py --check        verify, writing nothing

SOURCE_DIR defaults to the ``mesa-core`` symlink at the repository root.

``--check`` needs no source tree at all: it hashes the vendored files against
``tests/contract/mesa_core_vendor.json``, which IS tracked, so a clean checkout
(or CI, which has no mesa-core symlink) can tell a re-sync from a hand-edit. The
copy is ordinary Python that imports and passes tests whatever it says, so
nothing else would notice an edit to it.
