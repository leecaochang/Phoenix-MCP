# esphome.<device_name_with_underscores>_<action_name>. These are the only
# services the esphome domain has (its services.yaml is deliberately empty
# upstream) and their schema is built from ONLY the arguments the device
# declared, so they take no entity target. That makes them unreachable through
# the ordinary target-flattening path, which would both attach an entity_id the
# schema rejects and resolve to an empty target list.
#
# Authorization is the owning DEVICE's write scope rather than a capability: the
# action is defined by that device's own firmware and can act on nothing else, so
# an access key that may already actuate the device's entities is exactly the access key
# that may invoke its actions.
