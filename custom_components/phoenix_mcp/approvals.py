    Approve runs the saved action INLINE in the admin's own request, so the
    resolved event cannot fire until the tool has finished, which is seconds for
    a real write. For all of that time every surface showing the approval stays
    actionable: an admin who clicks Approve in Agent Chat can still click Reject
    in the panel, and the reverse. The store-lock claim already refuses the
    second action with a 409, so the OUTCOME was never wrong, but the operator
    was being shown a control that could not work and no signal that their first
    click had landed.

    This fires the moment the claim is taken, so every surface can go
    non-actionable immediately rather than waiting on the execution. It fires
    again with claimed=False when execution failed and left the approval pending
    and retryable, which is why this is a claim/release pair and not a second
    "resolved": a released approval is actionable again and must come back.

    Reject needs no counterpart. It resolves inside the store lock with nothing
    to execute, so its resolved event already fires promptly.
