    Buckets (token's own data, no entity oracle):
      usable        - announced and executes directly.
      needs_approval - cap-tied tool whose cap is Confirm AND which actually gates:
                      returns pending_approval.
      unavailable   - not usable (cap denied, a write/action tool without write
                      scope, or a tool whose required system surface is absent).

    THE `_EXECUTOR_REGISTRY` CHECK IS LOAD-BEARING, not a belt-and-braces extra.
    A Confirm cap does NOT mean every tool tied to it gates: a cap-tied READ
    (get_automation, get_dashboard_config, get_yaml_config, read_file, and 50-odd
    others) checks `effective_cap(...) == CAP_DENY` and never calls `_gate`, so it
    executes directly no matter what mode the cap is in. Bucketing by cap mode
    alone therefore reported every one of those as needing approval. That is not
    a cosmetic mislabel: this map IS `get_capability_summary`, the call the server
    instructions tell an agent to make FIRST to orient, so it mis-plans the whole
    session downstream. Live-found when an agent avoided free reads for an entire
    migration because the summary said they would queue for approval.

    Registering an executor is the right proxy because it is exactly what the
    Confirm flow requires: `async_execute_approved_tool` dispatches through
    `_EXECUTOR_REGISTRY`, so a tool that gates without one could never be applied
    after approval. `tests/test_mcp_tool_catalog.py` pins the registry against the
    handlers that really call `_gate`, in both directions, so the proxy cannot
    drift into a lie of its own.

    A tool unavailable because the system lacks its surface (no ESPHome, no
    Device Builder) also gets an entry in unavailable_reasons, which is emitted
    only when non-empty. That distinction matters to an agent: a denied
    capability is something the operator can grant, a missing add-on is not.

    This is a static, tool-level view. call_service and the native Hass* action
    tools appear "usable" when the token has write scope even though a specific
    target may still hit a physical/dual gate or MESA confirm at call time; use
    dry_run_service to preview an individual call. Mirrors _tool_is_announced so
    the summary and tools/list agree.

    It can also send an `id` that is an object, an array or a boolean, which was
    coerced to None and DISPATCHED anyway, so a malformed message could apply a
    side effect and then answer with an id its sender could not correlate.
    This gate runs before dispatch in BOTH the single-request and batch paths so

      ("dispatch", (method, params)) - a well-formed request to hand to _dispatch_mcp.
