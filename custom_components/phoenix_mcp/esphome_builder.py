"""Minimal client for the ESPHome Device Builder WebSocket API.

The Device Builder add-on exposes a multiplexed WebSocket API that the ESPHome
frontend itself speaks. Phoenix MCP uses a bounded slice of it: config
validation, the board / component / automation reference data that lets an
authoring agent look facts up instead of recalling them, and the firmware job
model (compile, install, poll, cancel) alongside device console logs and
backtrace decoding.

This is Phoenix MCP's only outbound network connection. It targets the same
host and port Home Assistant's own ESPHome dashboard coordinator already talks
to, over Home Assistant's shared aiohttp session, with no credentials involved.

SECURITY: the Device Builder has no permission model of its own. Its own threat
model states that an authenticated client can run arbitrary Python at config
time and arbitrary shell through ESPHome subprocess invocations, which makes an
authenticated session equivalent to shell access on the add-on's host. So the
allowlist below is the ONLY thing bounding what this client can reach. It is
checked before any session or socket work, so no caller can turn input into an
arbitrary command, and the commands deliberately left out of it are pinned off
by test rather than merely absent. Widening the set is a security decision
rather than a maintenance one, and the pinning tests exist to force that diff
through review.

Each call is one connection: connect, read the handshake, send one command,
close. Nothing is held between requests, matching the stateless transport
everywhere else in Phoenix MCP. Firmware jobs live server-side in the add-on and
are connection-independent, so a build outlives the request that started it and
Phoenix MCP needs no job store of its own.
