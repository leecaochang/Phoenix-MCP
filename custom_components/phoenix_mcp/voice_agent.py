"""Phoenix MCP as a Home Assistant conversation agent.

Registers Phoenix MCP directly as a conversation agent (conversation.async_set_agent), so
"Phoenix MCP" appears in Settings > Voice assistants and drives HA's native Assist/voice
pipeline using Phoenix MCP's OWN model loop, no separate LLM integration required. This is
the self-contained counterpart to the llm.API bridge (assist_api.py, which hands
Phoenix MCP's tools to a model supplied by another integration).

Everything model-side is reused from agentcli.py (the Agent Chat engine): the
provider accounts + keys (AgentCliStore), provider construction, and the gated
tool loop (async_run_voice_turn dispatches every tool through mcp_view._dispatch_mcp, so
per-token scope, MESA, approvals, and audit apply identically). A confirm-gated
action degrades to "queued, approve in the Phoenix MCP panel" (voice has no inline Approve
button); the turn never blocks. The bound token, provider, and model are configured
in Phoenix MCP's own panel (GlobalSettings.voice_agent_*), not an HA config-entry options flow.

This module is deliberately NOT named conversation.py so HA does not treat it as a
conversation ENTITY platform; Phoenix MCP uses the lighter non-entity async_set_agent path.
HA-COUPLING POINT alongside ws_dispatch / assist_api: the conversation agent API
(AbstractConversationAgent / ConversationResult / IntentResponse) can shift across
HA versions; re-verify on upgrades.
