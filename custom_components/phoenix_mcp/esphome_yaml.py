"""Credential masking for ESPHome device YAML.

ESPHome device files routinely carry credentials inline rather than behind
`!secret`: an API encryption key, an OTA password, a wifi password. Phoenix MCP
must be able to read and edit those files without ever handing the values to an
agent or writing them into an approval record, and without a blind write being
able to repoint a device at an attacker's network.

The approach is span-surgical. `yaml.compose` gives every scalar's exact source
span, so a placeholder is spliced into the RAW file text at those offsets and
nothing else moves. Comments, ordering, and formatting survive byte-for-byte,
which matters because these files are heavily commented; a parse-and-re-dump
round trip would silently destroy that.

Three detection layers feed one span set:

  1. Curated paths      known credential locations (api.encryption.key, ...).
  2. Key-name heuristic any scalar whose KEY looks like a credential, at any
                        depth, so a bindkey or a custom auth header is covered
                        without waiting for the curated list to learn about it.
  3. secrets.yaml       any scalar whose whole value matches a secrets.yaml
                        value, catching the same credential inlined in one file
                        while referenced by `!secret` in another.

Over-redaction is the accepted failure direction. Redacted spans are also
WRITE-FROZEN: a caller may replace one with a `!secret` reference (the supported
migration) but never with a different literal. Freezing is not only about
disclosure. `api.encryption.key` must match the noise PSK stored in HA's config
entry, and `ota[].password` governs the next upload's authentication, so a blind
change can leave a device unreachable, which is a physical-access problem for
anything mounted out of reach.

`secrets.yaml` itself is never readable or writable through any tool. Its values
are parsed here, internally, only to know what NOT to emit.
