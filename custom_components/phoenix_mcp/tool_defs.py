"""The published MCP tool catalog: schemas and annotations.

Declarative data only, no behaviour. Three def lists (entity / native HA /
system tools) and the `_TOOL_ANNOTATIONS` map that stamps every def with its four
MCP hints at import, so a tool added without one raises KeyError here rather than
silently shipping the spec's unsafe defaults.

Kept out of mcp_view, which owns the transport, the dispatch registry and the
executor registry and simply reads this catalog. Conventions for choosing each
hint live in the comment above the map.

Nothing here imports the transport, and mcp_view re-exports these names. Adding
a tool means adding a def here AND registering a handler in mcp_view; the two
are pinned against each other, and against the annotations and executor
registries, in both directions.

# descriptions ARE HA's verbatim and are pinned that way by
# tests/test_native_intent_parity.py; this divergence is deliberately confined to
# the parameters.
#
# The shape restatement ("as a string", "as an array of strings") is not
# redundant with the declared type. A model that sends a list where a string was
# declared has every selector coerced away, which resolves to no target at all
# and comes back as a refusal that reads like a permission problem rather than a
# malformed argument. Naming the shape in prose is what a model actually reads.
#
# Strings, not shared dicts: each schema below builds its own dict literal, so no
# two tools can ever alias one mutable object.
