"""Access-key-scoped wrappers around the vendored mesa-core retrieval tools.

mesa-core ships the four retrieval handlers (mesa_query_profiles,
mesa_get_profile, mesa_explain_profile, mesa_get_caller_context). Phoenix MCP does not
reimplement them; it builds a per-request ScopedProfileStore so the handlers
only ever see entities the access key may read, then delegates to mesa-core. This
keeps total_matched counts, pagination cursors, and the fingerprint all
scope-relative so there is no entity-enumeration oracle.

Out-of-scope and ghost entity lookups return the byte-identical mesa-core
not_found envelope, so an inaccessible entity is indistinguishable from a
nonexistent one.
