"""LeaseManager: advisory coordination leases (Enrichment Section 21).

The lease protocol is an advisory signal between MESA-aware components, not a
concurrency lock (Section 21.1). mesa-core owns no event loop, so automatic
expiry is lazy: an expired lease never grants anything, but it is removed, and
its ``mesa_lease_expired`` event emitted, only when a lifecycle operation
sweeps. ``request``, ``release``, ``release_session``, ``expire``, and
``sensor_state`` sweep; ``active_leases`` filters expired entries out of its
result without removing them or emitting, so it stays a side-effect-free read.
Hosts SHOULD therefore call ``expire()`` periodically for timely events rather
than relying on reads to produce them, and MUST call ``release_session()`` when
a session disconnects, since nothing else releases a session's holds early.
Events are delivered through the ``on_lease_event`` callback with the
Section 21.4 payload (``lease_id``, ``entities``, ``reason``, ``timestamp``);
the host bridges them onto the HA event bus.

Multi-agent priority preemption (Section 21.6) ships in v2. For overlapping
requests the existing holder takes precedence, which is 21.6 Rule 3, the
no-priority baseline; ``caller_priority`` is accepted but unused.

Default clocks are timezone-aware UTC. A caller-supplied ``now`` is used
as-is: inject consistently aware or consistently naive datetimes for one
manager's lifetime, since lease expiry compares them against each other.
