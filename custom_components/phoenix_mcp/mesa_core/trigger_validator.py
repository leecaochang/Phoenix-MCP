"""TriggerValidator: live validation of triggers_automations declarations (Spec 5.5).

Cross-references profiles declaring ``triggers_automations: none`` against the
actual HA automation configurations supplied by the host. An entity declared
``none`` that appears in an automation trigger or condition block is a stale
and unsafe declaration: agents will skip cascade caution for it.

mesa-core never calls HA: the host provides automation configs through the
``get_automation_configs`` callback, from any source (REST API, YAML parse, or
test fixture). Automations can also reference entities indirectly, through
device triggers and the target selectors of purpose-specific triggers
(HA 2026.7+); resolving those requires the host's ``expand_target`` callback,
because only the host can query the HA registries.
