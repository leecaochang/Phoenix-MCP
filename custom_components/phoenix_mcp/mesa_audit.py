"""Tail mesa-core's audit events into Phoenix MCP's own audit log.

mesa-core emits an event dict on the ``mesa_core.audit`` logger, one per
decision, with the structured payload on the record's ``mesa_audit_event``
attribute. Phoenix MCP records its OWN outcome for a call, so without this an
operator reading the Audit tab sees that a service call was denied but never
which entity MESA stopped or under which rule. Attaching a logging handler,
rather than keeping a second copy of mesa-core's decision logic, also captures
privacy denials and lease refusals that nothing in Phoenix MCP inspects.

TWO DELIBERATE LIMITS, both about keeping the Audit tab worth reading:

1. DENIALS ONLY, and a denial means one PHOENIX honored. Recording allowed
   traffic would put a row in the ring buffer for each in-scope entity of each
   call, evicting the real request history this log exists for; a
   confirm-approved allow is skipped for the further reason that it already has
   an approval record. The subtle case is ``control_mode:confirm_no_channel``,
   filtered by ``_NOT_A_DENIAL_RULES``: mesa-core labels it "blocked" because
   the enforcer runs with interactive=False, but Phoenix always reinterprets it
   host-side (advisory allows with a warning, enforced raises its own approval),
   so it is never a Phoenix denial. Recording it makes the tab list actions MESA
   did not stop, one row per confirm entity, for no block at all.

2. THE LOGGER'S LEVEL IS NOT TOUCHED. Forcing ``mesa_core.audit`` to INFO would
   override an operator's explicit logging config AND put a line in
   home-assistant.log for every event, which is the exact noise this bridge
   exists to avoid. HA's normal root level is WARNING unless configured otherwise.
   The consequence, worth knowing before trusting an empty log: where the
   effective logger level sits above INFO,
   mesa-core emits nothing, so the tab shows no MESA rows at all, which is
   indistinguishable from "MESA blocked nothing". See docs/mesa.html for the
   one-line entry that restores it.

Rows are attributed to the request that provoked them through a ContextVar set
by the actuation gate, MESA-tool adapter and camera privacy check. The preview tools
run the same enforcer to predict a verdict, and a preview is not a block: with
no context set, an event is dropped rather than logged against a request that
never happened.
