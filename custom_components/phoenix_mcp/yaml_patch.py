"""Key- and index-addressed splicing for a YAML document.

Replaces, adds, or removes ONE addressed value inside a YAML file while leaving
every other byte exactly as it was. An address is either a dotted `key` of
mapping keys or a `path` list mixing mapping keys and 0-based list indexes; the
list form is what reaches an entry in a file whose top level is a sequence,
which most !include targets are. Pure functions, no hass, following esphome_yaml.py
and yaml_includes.py; the tool that calls it lives in tools/config_files.py.

The approach is span-surgical for the same reason esphome_yaml's is. A
parse-and-re-dump round trip produces a semantically identical file and destroys
everything a human put there: comments, blank-line grouping, key order, quoting
style. configuration.yaml is hand-maintained and heavily commented, so rewriting
it wholesale to change one key is not an acceptable cost. `yaml.compose` gives
every node its exact source position, so the new text is spliced in at the
addressed key's own lines and nothing else moves.

Spans are computed in LINES rather than byte offsets, mirroring
yaml_includes._FileScan: PyYAML's end_mark for a block collection runs to the
start of the next token, which swallows the blank lines and comments that sit
between two keys and belong to the SECOND one. Each key's span therefore ends
where its next sibling begins, with trailing blank and comment lines trimmed back
out, so a comment written above a key stays with that key.

Two refusals are structural rather than cautious. Nothing is created along the
way, so a path whose parent is missing is a typo rather than an instruction to
build the tree (the resolve_json_path rule); and a flow-style collection ({...}
or [...] on one line) has no per-child line span to address, so anything inside
one is refused rather than guessed at. A negative index is refused for the same
reason resolve_json_path refuses one: Python would read it as counting from the
end, so a -1 computed off a stale read silently edits the wrong entry.

Every patch is VERIFIED before it is returned: the spliced text is re-parsed and
compared against the old document with only the addressed path changed. A span
bug therefore surfaces as a refusal rather than as a quietly mangled
configuration.yaml, which is the same self-check discipline yaml_includes applies
to its own splices. It is also what makes index addressing safe without a
deletion guard: that an entry the patch did not address survived is proved on
every write rather than assumed.
