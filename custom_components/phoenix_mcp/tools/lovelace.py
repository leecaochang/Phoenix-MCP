"""Lovelace tools: dashboard CRUD, whole-layout writes and card-level edits.

The dashboard surface in one module. Everything here rides cap_lovelace_write,
including the reads: a layout names entities and their placement, which is the
same information the writes edit, so the read tools gate on the write
capability rather than a separate read one.

Two write shapes, deliberately both: set_dashboard_config replaces a whole
layout, and the three card ops carry one card each, because a whole-layout
replace forces the model to regurgitate the entire dashboard inside one tool
call's arguments, which blows weaker providers' output limits.
Both guard with an optimistic-lock content_hash, checked pre-gate and again at
apply time so a change made during the approval window is caught.

mcp_view owns the transport, the dispatch registry and the executor registry, and
imports the names it registers or calls from here. The dependency runs one way:
this module never imports the transport that dispatches it. Shared primitives
come from ..tool_common.
