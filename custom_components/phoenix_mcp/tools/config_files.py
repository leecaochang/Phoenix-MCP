"""Config-file tools: the scoped filesystem jail and the raw YAML edit.

Two surfaces that both write files, kept together because they share the same
shape of risk and the same defence: resolve to a realpath, prove it is inside a
permitted directory, and refuse otherwise.

`cap_filesystem` covers www/, themes/ and custom_templates/ only
(const.FILESYSTEM_ALLOWED_DIRS). `_resolve_fs_path` is a real jail: it
realpaths and requires the result to sit under an allowed directory, so a
symlink or a traversal cannot escape it, and it cannot reach configuration.yaml
at all.

`cap_yaml_edit` covers configuration.yaml and the YAML files it loads through
an !include. Which files those are is not taken on trust: `_yaml_mount_refusal`
asks yaml_includes.scan_mount_points where a file lands in the configuration
tree and refuses anything reached from homeassistant:/http:/frontend:/lovelace:,
anything it cannot rule that out for, and anything nothing loads. That gate
exists because the content-shaped refusal below cannot see the case: an include
target's top level IS the value of the key it is loaded at, so `http.yaml` holds
trusted_proxies as an ordinary top-level key. It carries the
trust-boundary refusal: `_yaml_protected_check` hard-refuses any write that
adds, removes or modifies a path in const.YAML_PROTECTED_SUBTREES. The floor is
not "these keys are powerful" (command_line and shell_command stay writable,
because command execution is already accepted surface for this capability) but
"these keys redefine HA's OWN trust boundary": who may authenticate, which
proxy headers are trusted, whether brute-force defences run, which folder is
loaded as configuration, and what JavaScript loads into the authenticated
dashboard. It runs BOTH pre-gate and again at apply time against what is on
disk, so a change appearing during the approval window is still caught, and it
fails closed: content that does not parse as YAML is refused.

It also carries the accidental-deletion refusal, `_yaml_removal_check`: a write
that drops a top-level key present in the current file is refused unless
`remove_keys` names that key. Nothing else catches that case, because the file
is valid, no protected subtree moved, and expected_hash matches (the caller did
read first). Declaring the keys rather than setting a force flag is deliberate:
a bypass boolean gets set once and then always, while a named key lands in the
approval diff where a wrong claim is visible. Unlike the protected check this
one ABSTAINS in two cases: when the prior content is absent or unparseable
(refusing would make the tool unable to repair the broken file it exists to
repair), and on a version RESTORE, where reproducing the chosen snapshot
byte-for-byte is the whole operation and the admin has already seen it.

mcp_view owns the transport, the dispatch registry and the executor registry, and
imports the names it registers or calls from here. The dependency runs one way:
this module never imports the transport that dispatches it. Shared primitives
come from ..tool_common.

    read the file first. The worst shape is not a mangled file but a tidy one,
    e.g. dropping `automation: !include automations.yaml` disables every
    automation while automations.yaml sits on disk intact and check_config
    passes.

    Declaring a key is the escape hatch rather than a bare force flag: a single
    bypass boolean is set once and then always set, whereas naming the keys puts
    the intent in the approval diff where a wrong claim is visible.

    Both sides parse with the lenient loader, matching _protected_subtree_diff.
    Old content that is absent or does not parse yields NO removals, i.e. this
    check abstains rather than fails closed. That is deliberate: repairing a
    configuration.yaml that no longer parses is a legitimate use of this tool
    and refusing would make the tool unable to fix the one state that most needs
    fixing. The protected-subtree refusal still runs on that path.

    Assumes the NEW content already parsed, which holds because
    _yaml_protected_check runs first at both call sites and refuses if it did not.
