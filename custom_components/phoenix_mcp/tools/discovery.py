"""Discovery and analysis tools: the read-only half of the tool surface.

Everything here answers "what is there and what would happen", never "change
it". Three groups, sharing one property that is the reason they live together:
each one enumerates, and every enumeration is scoped to the token's permission
tree before it is returned, so a listing never becomes an oracle for entities
the token cannot see.

  - Registry reads: areas, floors, zones, devices, and the entity search /
    overview / describe family.
  - Relationship analysis: which automations, scripts and scenes reference an
    entity (`_references_for_entity`) and what it drives in turn
    (`_forward_references`), both walked out of the stored YAML configs.
  - Preview tools: whatif, compare_state, dry_run_service, validate_config,
    find_available_actions. These run the same gates a real call would and
    report the verdict without actuating, which is why dry_run_service and
    find_available_actions mirror the physical-gate and no-target-service rules
    rather than approximating them.

`_tool_get_capability_summary` deliberately stayed in mcp_view: it reports on
the PUBLISHED TOOL SURFACE through _tool_gate_map, so it belongs with the
registry that owns that surface, not with the tools that read Home Assistant.

mcp_view owns the transport, the dispatch registry and the executor registry, and
imports the names it registers or calls from here. The dependency runs one way:
this module never imports the transport that dispatches it. Shared primitives
come from ..tool_common.

    `dangling_references` is a list an operator is meant to ACT on, so a false
    positive is not harmless noise, it is what teaches them to ignore the field.
    Live first run: 26 entries of which about 20 were junk (`1.3em` from a card's
    CSS, `3.4` from a version string, `attributes.device_class` from a template,
    `deye_p3.yaml` from a filename, HA's `all` wildcard, and several `{{ }}`
    script targets) with a handful of genuinely dead references buried in it.

    THE FILTER STRENGTH MATCHES WHAT THE HOLDER KNEW, which is the whole design,
    and a value referenced from several places is kept if ANY holder vouches for
    it. A TYPED holder came from somewhere HA defines the shape: mesa-core's role
    walk, a script's `entity_id:` key, a scene's entity keys. Those strings were
    MEANT to be entity ids, so they are trusted outright. An untyped holder found
    the value by shape alone in a dashboard card or config-entry payload, where
    the key is whatever the author chose, so it also has to name a domain this
    instance actually has.

    A DOMAIN CHECK ON TYPED HOLDERS WOULD BE BACKWARDS and was tried first: a
    reference into a domain that no longer exists at all can never resolve, which
    makes it MORE dangling, not less. Its own test caught that.

    An untyped holder in a SERVICE-CALL POSITION is excluded unless the domain is
    `script`. A card's `perform_action: button.press` names a verb, not an entity,
    and has the exact shape of an id in the exact place the walk reads; running a
    script, though, IS its entity id, so a card pointing at a deleted script is
    the most valuable find here and must survive.

    THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THAT USED SERVICE REGISTRATION and it was wrong, which
    only the live data showed: it dropped anything `hass.services.has_service`
    recognised, reasoning that a live script's service is registered and a dead
    one's is not. Home Assistant can keep a script's service registered after the
    script is gone, so two references whose entities did not exist were filtered
    away, i.e. the rule suppressed exactly the class it was written to preserve.
    POSITION distinguishes a verb from an id and depends on no runtime state that
    can go stale.

    Template syntax is excluded everywhere: a value carrying `{{ }}` is an id
    computed at runtime, not one Phoenix can resolve. HA's `all` wildcard goes
    with it, having no dot to split on.

    """Every consumer touching an entity in `scope`, and every entity id seen.

    ONE pass per source, not one pass per entity. The tool it replaces asked
    about a single entity and re-read all three YAML files each time, so
    sweeping six devices' worth of entities took ~74 calls against a 60/min rate
    limit, 63 of them returning nothing. Scanning a SET collapses that to one.

    The second return value maps every entity id referenced by any consumer, in
    scope or not, to the consumers holding it. Naming the holder is what makes a
    dangling reference actionable: "script.x is dead" sends someone hunting,
    while "the Fridge dashboard calls it at views[0].cards[3]" is a repair. Each
    holder also records how much its source knew (`typed` when HA defines the
    shape, e.g. a role walk or an `entity_id:` key; `service` when the value sat
    where a service name goes), which is what _dangling_candidates filters on.
    All of it is free, since the walk has already visited every consumer.

    Runs in an executor because it reads the automation/script/scene YAML.
    Dashboards and config entries are snapshotted by the caller in the event
    loop, since obtaining them needs loop access, and are passed in.
