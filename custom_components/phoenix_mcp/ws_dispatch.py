"""In-process dispatch of Home Assistant WebSocket API commands.

Some HA capabilities (notably helper CRUD: input_boolean/create, etc.) are only
exposed through the WebSocket command API. There is no public host-side function
and the underlying storage collections are not reachable. This module invokes
HA's already-registered WS command handlers directly, in-process, with no socket
and no long-lived access token: it looks up the handler in
``hass.data["websocket_api"]``, validates the message against the registered
schema, and runs the handler against a synthetic ``ActiveConnection`` that
captures the result instead of writing to a socket.

This is the one place that leans on HA internals (`ActiveConnection`, the
`async_response` result flow). It is deliberately isolated here, with a version
shim and tests, so an HA change breaks this module loudly rather than the
callers. The create/update/delete commands are `@require_admin`, so dispatch
runs under a real admin user resolved from `hass.auth`; Phoenix MCP's own capability
gate (e.g. cap_helper_write + Confirm + audit) decides whether a call runs at
all, the same way create_automation performs a privileged file write under a cap.

# The only WS commands Phoenix MCP is permitted to dispatch in-process. async_ws_command
# refuses anything outside this set, so a future caller cannot turn user input
# into an arbitrary privileged command run as admin. Adding a command here is a
# deliberate act. Keep in sync with the callers in mcp_view.py (helper CRUD +
# list, backup read/create, lovelace dashboard CRUD), tools/discovery.py
# (loaded reference graph), and radio.py (the two ZHA reads). restore_backup is
# deliberately absent (too destructive). The helper
# "list" read is used to capture the pre-change config for version history.
# Most ZHA write-side commands (zha/devices/permit, zha/devices/reconfigure,
# zha/topology/update) are deliberately absent: their handlers enable
# process-wide ZHA debug logging and/or park cleanup callbacks in
# connection.subscriptions, which a synthetic capturing connection never
# releases, and reconfigure/topology never call send_result (guaranteed
# timeout). The scoped topology tool therefore awaits zigpy's scanner directly
# in radio.py. Permit and remove go through the zha.permit / zha.remove admin
# services instead; reconfigure goes through async_zha_reconfigure_device below.
# zha/devices/bind, zha/devices/unbind, and the group CRUD commands are the
# narrow exceptions: they await ZHA's own operation and then call send_result
# without registering a subscription. Phoenix resolves every IEEE and numeric
