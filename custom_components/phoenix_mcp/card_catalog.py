"""Dashboard card catalog: which Lovelace cards this instance can actually render.

Phoenix MCP's dashboard write tools accept any card dict with a non-empty string
`type`, so an agent authoring a dashboard cannot learn which custom cards are
installed. This module holds a cached catalog of every card type the instance can
render, with a one-line description, a documentation URL, and a worked stub config.

The catalog is HARVESTED IN A BROWSER, not read off disk. A card announces itself by
pushing onto `window.customCards` (the registry HA's own card picker reads) at runtime.
A static parse of the plugin JS yields nothing for cards that build their type strings
by concatenation or never register in the picker, and cannot recover descriptions or
stub configs, so it finds far fewer cards and would give a misleading catalog.

The frontend harvester posts here through the admin API. The payload is assembled
from third-party card code, so every field is coerced, bounded, and dropped on doubt.

A NEVER-HARVESTED CATALOG IS NOT AN EMPTY ONE. `harvested_at is None` means no browser
has reported yet, and callers must say so rather than report zero cards: an agent told
"you have no custom cards" avoids every custom card on the system.
