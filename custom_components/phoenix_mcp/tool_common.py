"""Shared primitives for the MCP tool surface.

The pieces every tool handler needs regardless of domain: the MCP content
envelopes (_tool_success/_tool_error/_tool_pending), the capability gate and its
inline-confirm wait, the progress bus the SSE writer drains, configuration
version capture, and the scoped file read/write plus compare-and-swap helpers.

These live here rather than in mcp_view so a per-domain tool module (see
tools/) can depend on them without importing the transport that dispatches it,
which would be a cycle. mcp_view re-exports every name here.

    """A pending approval, held inline when the token is configured to wait.

    ONE definition, because there is more than one kind of confirm gate and they
    must not answer differently. `_gate` had this logic inline for a CAPABILITY
    confirm; the MESA confirm gates (call_service and the native tools) reached
    their own `_tool_pending` returns and never consulted
    `confirm_inline_wait_seconds` at all. So an operator who configured an inline
    wait got it for one kind of confirm and not the other, which is not a
    distinction anything states or intends.

    The second consequence was the worse one: `_OPERATOR_ACCEPTED_NOTE` is
    appended only when an approval resolves INLINE (here) or through Agent Chat,
    so a MESA confirm could never deliver it. That note exists to stop an agent
    revising a change the operator already accepted, which is exactly the loop a
    MESA-gated actuation invites.

    THE WAIT IS SKIPPED WHEN A BACKLOG ALREADY EXISTS, and that is what makes
    batch approval usable at all. The hold is a per-request block, and tool calls
    arrive one at a time, so approval N+1 cannot even be CREATED until approval N
    has finished waiting. Live-measured at a 60s wait: consecutive approvals
    appeared 62.8 seconds apart, i.e. a twenty-write migration would have taken
    twenty minutes just to fill the queue an operator is being asked to review in
    one go. The wait and batching were working against each other.

    So: if this token already has another approval pending, do not hold. The
    reasoning is not merely mechanical - an operator with something already
    unresolved is demonstrably not in instant-approve mode, so blocking buys the
    agent nothing and costs the queue everything. The FIRST call still waits,
    which is what preserves the interactive feel for a lone confirm, and the
    instant-approve workflow is untouched: there each approval resolves within
    seconds, so the queue is empty again by the next call and every call still
    waits. Twenty writes go from ~20 minutes to ~60 seconds.

    Inferred rather than declared by the caller deliberately. An explicit per-call
    flag would have to land on 40-odd write tools (moving the catalog fingerprint
    for every connected client), or ride in `params._meta`, which not every client
    can set; and an agent that forgot it would silently reintroduce the stall.
