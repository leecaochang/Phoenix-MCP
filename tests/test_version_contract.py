"""The release version is stated in four files and nothing kept them equal.

`const.PHOENIX_VERSION` is what an operator and an MCP client both see: it is the
`serverInfo.version` of every `initialize` handshake and the `version` field of
the admin info endpoint. `manifest.json` is what Home Assistant and HACS read to
decide whether an update is available. `package.json` and its lock file version
the panel bundle built from the same tree.

Nothing tied them together, so the first bump that touched one and forgot
another would ship an integration claiming one version to HACS and a different
one to every connected client, which is the kind of drift nobody notices until
someone is debugging a version-specific report. That is the same failure the
Home Assistant floor had before `test_ha_version_floor.py`, in a second place.

The lock file is npm-generated and follows `package.json` on the next install,
so it is checked rather than trusted: a hand-edited bump that skips `npm install`
leaves it behind, and the committed file is what a clean checkout builds from.
