"""Pin the counts the documentation states against the code.

Counts embedded in prose are the part of the docs that rots silently: nothing
breaks, the sentence still reads fine, and the number is only wrong. The
capability count on the overview page went stale twice, the tool count drifted
in two places at once, and then a written-out "Eighty-six tools" sat invisible
to this very test because its word dictionary only knew nine through
twenty-five, so the checks are mechanical and the word list is generated.

The counts themselves come from mcp_view.tool_catalog_counts(), the single
source of truth (also served by the admin info endpoint). Nothing here re-derives them from the def lists.

The localized READMEs restate the same headline counts and are scanned by their
own patterns, because the English one cannot match a CJK noun (see NUMBER_ZH and
NUMBER_JA). A translated count that nothing checks is the original defect in a
second language.

Word-numbers below nine are deliberately unchecked: prose legitimately counts
subsets that small ("four retrieval tools", "Three panel tools"). Every real
catalog count is far above it, and "hundred"/"thousand" anywhere near a counted
noun fails outright with instructions to use digits, so a written-out total can
never slip past again.

`docs/` at the repo root is the only copy of the documentation. It is published
as a hosted site; the integration ships no copy of it.
