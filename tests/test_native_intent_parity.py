"""The native Hass* tool surface stays in step with the intents the installed HA
registers.

The Hass* names and their descriptions snapshot what Home Assistant generates at
runtime: HA builds each tool from an intent handler's own `description` and
`slot_schema` (helpers/llm.py), while Phoenix MCP freezes the strings into
tool_defs.py so the catalog is static and needs no integration set up to serve.
Every way the two can diverge is silent: a reworded description keeps saying the
old thing, a renamed intent leaves a tool pointing at nothing, and an intent HA
adds is never considered.

These tests close all three directions and pin the triage list below, so an intent
HA starts registering fails here until somebody records why Phoenix MCP does or does
not publish it.

The registry only holds intents whose component is set up, so this checks the core
actuator surface in _INTENT_COMPONENTS rather than every intent a given installation
might have. That covers every intent Phoenix mirrors.
