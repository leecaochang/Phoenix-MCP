"""The Energy dashboard tools: get_energy_config and edit_energy_config.

The Energy dashboard is the one place Home Assistant records that a statistic has
a ROLE (grid / solar / battery / gas / water / individual device), in
.storage/energy where no other Phoenix MCP read reaches. Removing an integration
therefore orphans an Energy source silently.

The READ tests pin what makes it safe: it is scoped to the access key (energy/get_prefs
runs as admin, so an unscoped passthrough would leak every statistic on the
instance), and a never-configured instance is an answer rather than an error.

The WRITE tests pin the property the design rests on: energy/save_prefs
FULL-REPLACES each top-level key it receives, so only a key the operation changed
may be sent. Sending any other would put every entry under it at the mercy of
whatever the tool reconstructed. The other load-bearing pair is the addressing
asymmetry: a statistic being WRITTEN must resolve for the access key, while one used
to ADDRESS an existing entry must not have to, because a dead entry is addressed
by the very id that stopped resolving, and refusing it would make the broken
entries the only ones unfixable.
