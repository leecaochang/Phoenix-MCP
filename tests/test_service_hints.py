"""helpers.service_not_found_hint: valid core verbs for a mistyped service name.

The hint turns an opaque ServiceNotFound into a list of valid core service verbs
for a curated set of actuator domains, so an agent that guessed the wrong verb
(valve.open instead of valve.open_valve) can self-correct. It is consulted only
after authorization; see DOMAIN_SERVICE_HINTS in const.py for the leak-safety
rationale. The hardcoded verbs are cross-checked against the installed HA core,
so an upgrade that renames or drops one fails.
