"""The three native vacuum tools.

HassVacuumStart and HassVacuumReturnToBase are ordinary domain-locked action tools.
HassVacuumCleanArea is not: its `area` names the room to CLEAN and is passed to the
service as cleaning_area_id, so feeding it to entity resolution the way every other
native tool feeds `area` would both target the wrong entities and quietly widen the
call.

The feature filter is the other load-bearing piece. HA's vacuum intents set
required_features, so a vacuum that cannot perform the operation is never targeted;
without the mirror the service would be called anyway and the tool would report
success for a vacuum that ignored it.

Patches target tools.native directly, never mcp_view's re-exported names: a
monkeypatch on a re-export fails silently and leaves these assertions passing.
