"""Pin the enumerable parts of the docs site against the code.

Nearly all documentation drift is of one class: enumerable facts (tool
parameters, provider kinds, error codes, SSE frame names, routes, capability
lists) restated by hand and left behind by code changes. Everything here derives
the expectation from the code side, so a tool, provider, code, frame, route, or
capability added tomorrow is covered without a new test being written.

Extraction-based checks assert a floor on how much they extracted, so a
refactor that breaks the extraction fails loudly instead of passing vacuously
(the mutation-pin lesson: absence assertions are the likeliest to be vacuous).

`docs/` at the repo root is the only copy of the documentation. It is published
as a hosted site; the integration ships no copy of it.

    is invisible to every one of them. `edit_energy_config` gained `rename_device`
    and `remove_source` on an already-documented, already-required parameter, and
    nothing would have failed had the article not been updated with them. An enum
    value is not an implementation detail; it is a thing the tool DOES, which is
    exactly what a reader is looking for.

    Deliberately NOT extended to optional parameters. There are hundreds across
    135 tools, many of them narrow refinements whose place is the schema rather
    than the prose, and forcing each into the docs would trade this drift for
    noise. Enum values are bounded and each one names a distinct behaviour.

    Values are matched case-insensitively and only where the enum is a list of
    strings, so a numeric or mixed enum is skipped rather than producing a
    nonsense expectation. Exemptions carry a written reason, per house style, so
    the next one has to be argued for rather than quietly added.

    `mode`, get_statistics's prose said "5-minute" while the value you actually
    pass is `5minute`, mesa_query_profiles had no parameter list at all, and
