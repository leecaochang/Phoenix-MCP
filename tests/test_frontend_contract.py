"""Frontend/backend contract drift guard for the admin token response.

The frontend's TokenRecord type (frontend_src/types.ts) is hand-mirrored from the
Python TokenRecord serializer, so they could drift silently. This test pins the
serialized key set against a shared committed fixture
(tests/contract/token_record_keys.json); the matching frontend test asserts the
TS type covers the same keys.

If TokenRecord.to_dict gains or loses a field, this test fails. To resolve:
  1. regenerate tests/contract/token_record_keys.json from the serializer, and
  2. update frontend_src/types.ts + contract.test.ts to match.
