"""Guard: the declared Home Assistant floor must match what the code imports.

`MIN_HA_VERSION` is a compatibility CLAIM, and nothing checked it. It said
2024.5.0 while `panel.py` imported `StaticPathConfig`,
`async_register_static_paths` and `remove_extra_js_url`, none of which exist
before 2024.7.0, so the two advertised releases raised `ImportError` before
setup finished. HACS reads the number out of `hacs.json` and lets the install
proceed, which is the whole failure: the claim was checked by nobody and
believed by the installer.

Neither half of that is catchable by the rest of the suite. The Python floor
guard parses SYNTAX and says nothing about which HA APIs exist; the suite itself
runs on one pinned modern HA, where every import resolves. So the checks here
are the ones that can be made offline, without a second HA installed:

  1. The number is stated identically everywhere it is stated. Four files
     restate it and they drifted independently before.
  2. Every module-level `from homeassistant...` import in the package is listed
     in `KNOWN_IMPORTS` below with the release that introduced it, and none of
     those releases is newer than the floor. A new module-level HA import fails
     here until someone writes down when it landed, which is the step that was
     skipped.

Rule 2 covers only UNGUARDED module-level imports, which is deliberate and is
the boundary that matters: those run during setup and an absent name is a failed
integration. An import inside a function or a `try` degrades to a clean error at
call time, so the four post-floor APIs the package does reach that way
(`lovelace.const.LOVELACE_DATA` before 2025.2, `condition.async_get_all_descriptions`,
`websocket_api.automation`, and the ai_task / conversation / llm feature probes)
are correctly out of scope here and are documented as optional-feature floors
instead.

Verifying an introduction version needs the upstream tag and is therefore a
human step, not something this test can do offline. `KNOWN_IMPORTS` is where
that verification is recorded; check a new entry against
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/home-assistant/core/<tag>/<path>` before
adding it.
