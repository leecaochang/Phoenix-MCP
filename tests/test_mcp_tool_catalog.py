    _tool_gate_map buckets a Confirm-cap tool as needs_approval only when it is in
    _EXECUTOR_REGISTRY, because a cap-tied READ never calls _gate and would
    otherwise be reported as queueing for approval. That substitution is sound only
    while the two sets agree, so both directions are pinned: a gating tool with no
    executor could never be applied after approval, and a non-gating tool with one
    would misreport a read as approval-gated.

    Scoped to cap-tied tools: HassTurnOn/HassTurnOff gate through a helper, and
    call_service_mesa_approved is the MESA sentinel executor that _call_tool never
    dispatches; none of the three is cap-tied.
