"""Pin the approval-diff summary templates against the panel catalog.

The summary an admin reads before approving is the confirm gate's safety
property. It is produced by Python and rendered by the panel, so the two must be
the same sentence. These tests are what make that mechanical rather than a
convention someone has to remember.

They are deliberately cheap and pure: no hass, no builders invoked. What they
check is the CONTRACT between const.DIFF_SUMMARY_TEMPLATES, the generated
en.json entries, and the keys the builders actually name.
