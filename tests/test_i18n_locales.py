"""Every shipped locale must be complete and consistent with the English catalog.

A key missing from a locale renders English in the middle of a translated
screen; a key whose {placeholder} set drifted is DELETED by Home Assistant and
falls back to English with only a log line. So a new English string is not
finished until every locale has it, or the key is listed in the checker's
KEEP_ENGLISH manifest with a reason.

The checks live in scripts/i18n_check_locale.py so the same logic serves the
command line and the suite.
