"""Every tool argument the code READS must be one the tool PUBLISHES.

An argument a handler acts on but the `inputSchema` never declares is invisible
to the caller, and a client that validates against the schema cannot send it at
all: the omission is enforced on its side, which no amount of server leniency
reaches. That is the same class as the stale-catalog case in mcp_view, arriving
through a different door.

It shipped once. `set_yaml_config` grew a `remove_entries` argument, the removal
guard refused a write and told the agent to pass it, and the schema did not list
it, so a well-behaved agent was handed an instruction it could not follow and
fell back to asking the operator to edit the file by hand. Nothing caught it:
test_mcp_tool_catalog.py pins the registry against the def lists, not the
arguments against the schema, and every behavioural test passed the argument
directly rather than through a schema.

The walk is per MODULE rather than per tool, deliberately. Arguments are read
far from the handler that received them (`remove_entries` is read in
`_declared_entry_removals`, three calls down from `_tool_set_yaml_config`), so
attributing a read to one tool would need real dataflow analysis. The union of
what a module reads against the union of what its tools declare is coarser but
answers the question that matters: is this argument published ANYWHERE. That is
exactly the check the shipped defect would have failed.

Two kinds of read are legitimately unpublished and are exempted by name with a
reason. An ALIAS is a spelling a model might guess, accepted quietly so a near
miss still works. An INTERNAL argument is one only Phoenix passes to an executor
(a restore replaying a snapshot), deliberately withheld because publishing it
would hand callers a capability the tool refuses on purpose. Both are the
opposite of the defect above, where the tool names an argument it does not
publish.
