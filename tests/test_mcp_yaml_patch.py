"""patch_yaml_config and the yaml_patch splice engine behind it.

The property the whole feature rests on is that a patch changes ONE key and nothing
else: not the comments, not the ordering, not the spacing, and not the approval an
operator has to read. So the assertions here are mostly about what did NOT move,
which is the opposite of how the whole-file tool is tested.
