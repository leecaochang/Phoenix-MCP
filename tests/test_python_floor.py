"""Guard: Phoenix MCP's own source must parse on its declared Python floor.

The floor is Python 3.12, and it is DERIVED rather than chosen: it tracks the
`REQUIRED_PYTHON_VER` of the oldest supported Home Assistant, so no install this
integration runs on has an older interpreter. It is currently one release
CONSERVATIVE. The HA floor moved to 2025.2.0, which declares `(3, 13, 0)`, so
3.13 is what the derivation now allows; the guard stays at 3.12 because a
stricter floor is always safe (3.12 syntax parses on 3.13) and loosening it buys
nothing until some change actually wants newer syntax. Raise it to 3.13 then,
deliberately, rather than as a side effect.

Nothing else enforces it. The suite runs on a much newer interpreter, where
later syntax simply works, and a type checker cannot enforce it either: its
target-version setting applies when parsing DEPENDENCIES too, and Home Assistant
itself uses syntax newer than this floor, which aborts the run before it checks
anything of ours.

`ast.parse(..., feature_version=(3, 12))` is the one mechanism that checks only
our files, and it rejects exactly the constructs that matter (type parameter
defaults, unparenthesized except groups, t-strings) while accepting everything
3.12 allows (PEP 695 `type` statements and generic parameter lists, PEP 604
unions, match statements, ExceptionGroup syntax).

Scope is Phoenix's own package. The vendored mesa_core is a copy of a separate
project and is excluded. Tests and scripts are excluded too: they never run on
a user's HA install.
