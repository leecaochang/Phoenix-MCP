"""Phoenix's own entities are invisible on every surface that lists entities.

The domain blocklist covers the phoenix_mcp DOMAIN, but the telemetry sensors
are `sensor.*` entities registered to the phoenix_mcp PLATFORM, so the blocklist
never sees them and a separate `entry.platform == DOMAIN` check does the real
work. That check lives in policy_engine.resolve and again in each pass-through
FAST PATH that skips resolve() for speed (the admin permission tree, the admin
token-scope endpoint, the MCP context endpoint). A re-implementation of a policy
drifts, so each copy is pinned here rather than only the canonical one.

Every test asserts the DROP: a check that the ordinary entity is present passes
unchanged when the filter stops excluding anything.
