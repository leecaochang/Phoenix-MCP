"""A read that returns fewer rows than matched has to say so.

An agent cannot ask a follow-up question about data it does not know was
withheld. A clipped page that looks complete is worse than an error, because the
agent proceeds confidently on a partial world: fifty errors out of fifty reads as
a bounded problem, fifty out of five hundred does not, and before this contract
`get_logs` returned the two identically. That tool is the one an agent reaches
for to answer "is anything wrong with this instance", so it was the worst place
in the surface to be silent.

Two kinds of test here. The behavioural ones pin the actual field values for each
paginating MCP read. The AST guard covers the tools nobody has written yet: it
finds every limit-slice in the package and requires the enclosing function to
report either `truncated`, a pre-slice `total`, or the cursor pair `has_more`
plus `next_cursor`, so a new paginating read cannot ship silent.
