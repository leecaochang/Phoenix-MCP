"""No native tool actuates Home Assistant without passing MESA.

MESA runs last, on the flattened entity list, on EVERY service-call path,
including the native Hass* tools. Two native tools cannot go through
_tool_intent_action: HassCancelAllTimers, whose native contract requires a
speech_slots count that function does not emit, and HassBroadcast, which picks
its own assist_satellite targets. Both therefore call _mesa_gate_native
directly; calling hass.services.async_call without it would cancel a read_only
timer that the identical call through _tool_intent_action denies.

Two kinds of test, deliberately. The behavioural ones run a real MesaRuntime and a
real service registration, so they assert the service did not fire rather than that
some mock was not called. The structural one enumerates every actuation site in the
package, so a THIRD such tool fails here instead of shipping the same gap.
