/**
 * The shared approval-event subscriber, used by BOTH bundles.
 *
 * The panel and the injected Agent Chat window are separate bundles sharing no
 * module state, so both must learn that an approval was acted on elsewhere
 * through this one module. Agent Chat has no `hass` of its own, and its SSE
 * stream only reports a resolution once the agent's turn resumes. These tests
 * pin the subscriber's contract.
