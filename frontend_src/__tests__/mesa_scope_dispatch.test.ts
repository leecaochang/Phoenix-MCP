/** Guard: each MESA scope reaches its OWN endpoints.
 *
 * The editor routes load/save/delete per inheritance level through an
 * exhaustive lookup, which tsc checks, so a scope it does not name cannot be
 * silently written to the AREA endpoint. What tsc cannot check is that each
 * entry calls the RIGHT endpoint, since every entry has the same shape, so a
 * copy-paste that leaves a device entry pointing at the area API type-checks
 * perfectly. These assertions read the URL that was actually requested.
