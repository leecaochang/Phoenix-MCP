/**
 * The visual Preview for an Energy approval.
 *
 * Energy has no Lovelace layout, so the hui-card preview the dashboard tools use
 * has nothing to render, and HA's own energy cards read preferences from the
 * backend collection rather than from card config: one embedded here would show
 * the CURRENT dashboard regardless of what the approval proposes, which is worse
 * than no picture. This renders the configuration itself.
 *
 * The property worth pinning is the KEYING. Rows pair by statistic (devices) and
 * by type (sources), never by display name, so a rename reads as one substitution
 * rather than an unrelated removal plus addition. That is why an operator would
 * rather look at this than at a long JSON document where one string differs.
