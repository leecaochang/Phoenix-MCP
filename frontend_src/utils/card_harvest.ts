/**
 * Dashboard card catalog harvester.
 *
 * Builds the list of custom Lovelace cards this instance can actually render and
 * posts it to the backend, so the MCP tool surface can answer "what cards do I
 * have" before an agent authors one.
 *
 * WHY THIS RUNS IN THE BROWSER. A card announces itself by pushing onto
 * `window.customCards`, the registry HA's own card picker reads, and it does so
 * at runtime. Roughly half of a real plugin set builds its type strings by
 * concatenation, so those strings never appear as literals in the shipped
 * bundle: Mushroom assembles all 18 of its types from `"mushroom"` plus a
 * suffix. Measured on a 24-plugin instance, parsing the files on disk found 16
 * types with no descriptions and no examples, while this found 65 cards, most
 * with a worked example config. The backend genuinely cannot do this.
 *
 * Design rules, matching the MESA injector next door:
 *  - Admin only, and every entry point is wrapped so a throw logs and no-ops.
 *    A harvest failure must never break the panel or an HA page.
 *  - Best effort per card: one card whose getStubConfig throws costs that card
 *    its example, never the whole catalog.
 *  - Idempotent and cheap to repeat. `import()` is deduplicated by URL in the
 *    browser, so on an instance where HA already loaded the resources the import
 *    loop is a no-op; on one that starts cold it does the real work.
